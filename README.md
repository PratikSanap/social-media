# social-media
there are two directories , Client-frontend code, server-backend code
to run the application:-
navigate to directories Client and server and run command "npm install"
after that on directory Client run command npm run dev which will start the frontend 
then on directory server firstly navigate to directory /src/prisma and then run the command "prisma migrate dev"
after successful connection to database , on directory src run command nodemon index.js which will run the backend code.
this application has not been deployed.
I tried to deploy the backend and it has been deployed , but i falied to deploy frontend,
